### Getting Started

First, create a new React project if you don’t already have one:

```bash

cd newsletter-component
```

## Customization Tips

1. **Change Colors**: Modify `bg-gray-800` or `bg-blue-500` in Tailwind to match your branding.
2. **Add Animations**: Use Tailwind’s transition utilities for hover effects.
3. **Validation**: Enhance the form by integrating validation libraries like `Formik` or `Yup`.
