JavaScript is a versatile and powerful language that enables developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications. To take full advantage of JavaScript, itâ€™s essential to understand its advanced concepts, such as **closures**, **prototypes**, and **asynchronous programming**.

## Closures

A closure is a function that "remembers" the variables from its lexical scope even when executed outside that scope.

### Example:

```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0
  return function () {
    count++
    return count
  }
}

const counter = createCounter()
console.log(counter()) // 1
console.log(counter()) // 2
```
